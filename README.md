# Running the project

1. Clone the repository or download the project files from GitHub.
2. Navigate to the root directory of the project using the cd command from your terminal.
3. Make sure you have Node.js and nodemon installed on your system.
4. Run `nodemon src/index.js`
5. Your web browser should automatically open the application. If not, you can manually navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

From here you can play around with creating an account, going to your (empty) list of recipes, create new recipes. Public recipes will be visible to everyone so you can play around with creating several accounts and seeing your recipes from other accounts, or filtering to see only your recipes.
